# Hello World: Experimentation repository

This is a personal repository is used for experimenting with various features of GitHub, Travis-CI, and other on-line features that are difficult to experiment with locally. There is nothing particularly interesting here.

## GitHub Pages

### Personal experimentation

#### Special characters

Single quotes are an issue on raw GitHub pages. e.g. '--a|abc num [,num...]'. Whereas backquote is fine: `--a|abc num [,num...]`. But suppose you want the single quote?

*The following material is boilerplate generated by GitHub Pages during initial creation.*

### Editing GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jondegenhardt/helloworld/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jondegenhardt/helloworld/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
